## One provider to rule them all

Dex supports a wide range of identity providers such as LDAP, SAML, and OAuth2 and implements [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/),
allowing your application to plug in any upstream identity provider, but implement only OIDC.

Whether you're looking to secure your internal applications, provide seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) across your organization, or create a secure public-facing platform,
Dex can be tailored to meet your unique requirements.

## Single-Sign On

Avoid implementing registration and login forms when you don't have to.
Let users login with the identity provider of their (or your) choice and focus on your application logic instead of securing identity management.
