If a person (or their company) that uses Dex demonstrates an understanding of this
project (either by submitting PRs to Dex or related projects such as Helm
charts) and the ability to work productively (for a longer period of time) with the community, that person
can have write access to the project. We want to be liberal with this privilege
and enable companies using Dex to have a voice in its development.

At the same time we realize that this can pose as trust issue to some users,
so we enforce the following rules to establish trust between new maintainers and the community:

- The first few PRs (5-10 depending on the size) by new maintainers must be approved by an existing maintainer
(preferably from a different company).
- New maintainers will receive write access to the repository, but not to other resources,
  for example the container image repository, to prevent new maintainers from being able to unilaterally push images.

If you would like access, please email [@sagikazarmark](https://github.com/sagikazarmark/) at [mark.sagikazar@gmail.com](mailto:mark.sagikazar@gmail.com)
stating your case or (preferably) open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues). Come join the fun ðŸ˜ƒ
