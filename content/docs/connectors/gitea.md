## Overview

One of the login options for dex uses the Gitea OAuth2 flow to identify the end user through their Gitea account.

When a client redeems a refresh token through dex, dex will re-query Gitea to update user information in the ID Token. To do this, __dex stores a readonly Gitea access token in its backing datastore.__ Users that reject dex's access through Gitea will also revoke all dex clients which authenticated them through Gitea.

## Configuration

Register a new OAuth consumer with [Gitea](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/oauth2-provider/) ensuring the callback URL is `(dex issuer)/callback`. For example if dex is listening at the non-root path `https://auth.example.com/dex` the callback would be `https://auth.example.com/dex/callback`.

The following is an example of a configuration for `examples/config-dev.yaml`:

```yaml
connectors:
- type: gitea
  # Required field for connector id.
  id: gitea
  # Required field for connector name.
  name: Gitea
  config:
    # Credentials can be string literals or pulled from the environment.
    clientID: $GITEA_CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: $GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET
    redirectURI: http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/callback
    # optional, default = https://gitea.com
    baseURL: https://gitea.com
```
