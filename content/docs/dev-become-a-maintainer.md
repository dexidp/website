If a person or their company uses dex, has demonstrated an understanding of this
project (either by submitting PRs to dex or related projects such as Helm
charts), and the ability to work productively with the community, that person
can have write access to this repo. We want to be liberal with this privilege
and enable companies using dex to have a voice in its development.

The first 10 PRs by new maintainers must be approved by a maintainer from a
different company.

Access to https://quay.io/dexidp will be restricted to @srenatus, @rithujohn191
and @ericchiang to prevent new maintainers from being able to unilaterally push
images.

If you would like access, please email @ericchiang at ericchiang@google.com
stating your case or open a public issue. Come join the fun ðŸ˜ƒ
