This section explains how you can develop for the Dex project and documents what steps need to be done at each phase of development (setting up the development environment, running tests, submitting changes, releasing software, etc).

Dex is an open source software (licensed under the Apache-2.0 license) and contributions (of any kind) are more than welcome from anyone in the community.
