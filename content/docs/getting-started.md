## Container image

Dex is primarily distributed as a container image, published to the following locations:

- [ghcr.io/dexidp/dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/pkgs/container/dex)
- [docker.io/dexidp/dex](https://hub.docker.com/r/dexidp/dex/tags)

2 variants (`alpine` and `distroless`) of container images are provided
based on Alpine Linux and Distroless base images.

A reference Kubernetes Helm chart for dex can be found at [charts.dexidp.io](charts.dexidp.io).

## Building the dex binary

To build dex from source code, install a working Go environment with version 1.19 or greater according to the [official documentation][go-setup].
Then clone the repository and use `make` to compile the dex binary.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dexidp/dex.git
$ cd dex/
$ make build
```

## Configuration

Dex exclusively pulls configuration options from a config file. Use the [example config][example-config] file found in the `examples/` directory to start an instance of dex with a sqlite3 data store, and a set of predefined OAuth2 clients.

```bash
./bin/dex serve examples/config-dev.yaml
```

The [example config][example-config] file documents many of the configuration options through inline comments. For extra config options, look at that file.

### Templated configuration

The default entrypoint for distributed container images utilize [gomplate][gomplate]
to pre-process configuration files (`.tpl`, `.tmpl`, `.yaml`) passed as arguments.
This enables templating any field from the environment, for example:

```yaml
secret: "{{ .Env.MY_SECRET_ENV }}"
```

See [gomplate docs][gomplate-docs] for templaating syntax.

## Running a client

Dex operates like most other OAuth2 providers. Users are redirected from a client app to dex to login. Dex ships with an example client app (built with the `make examples` command), for testing and demos.

By default, the example client is configured with the same OAuth2 credentials defined in `examples/config-dev.yaml` to talk to dex. Running the example app will cause it to query dex's [discovery endpoint][oidc-discovery] and determine the OAuth2 endpoints.

```bash
./bin/example-app
```

Login to dex through the example app using the following steps.

1. Navigate to the example app at http://localhost:5555/ in your browser.
2. Hit "login" on the example app to be redirected to dex.
3. Choose an option to authenticate:
   - "Login with Example" to use mocked user data.
   - "Login with Email" to fill the form with static user credentials `admin@example.com` and `password`.
4. Approve the example app's request.
5. See the resulting token the example app claims from dex.

## Further reading

Dex is generally used as a building block to drive authentication for other apps. See [_"Writing apps that use Dex"_][using-dex] for an overview of instrumenting apps to work with dex.

For a primer on using LDAP to back dex's user store, see the OpenLDAP [_"Getting started"_](/docs/connectors/ldap/#getting-started) example.

Check out the Documentation directory for further reading on setting up different storages, interacting with the dex API, intros for OpenID Connect, and logging in through other identity providers such as Google, GitHub, or LDAP.
