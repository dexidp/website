{{< card header="📣 **Announcements**" >}}
The primary channel for release announcements is <a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex/discussions/categories/announcements">GitHub Discussions</a>.
We also post information about other important changes there.

<p>
Security vulnerabilities are tracked on GitHub and are published as <a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories?state=published">security advisories</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the above, we also usually cross-post announcements to our <a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/dexidp">Slack channel</a> on CNCF Slack.

{{< card header="🛡️ **Reporting security vulnerabilities**" >}}
If you've found a security vulnerability, please follow the disclosure process outlined <a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/master/.github/SECURITY.md">here</a>.
<br/><br/>
Alternatively, you can <a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/new">open a draft security advisory</a> on GitHub.
This is where we keep track of vulnerabilities (and the work necessary to fix them) anyway,
so you can help us by filling out the necessary details in advance.
