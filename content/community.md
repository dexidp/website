## Questions and help

- Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/discussions/new?category=q-a) for discussions and asking questions
- Search the [documentation](/docs/)
- Join the [Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/dexidp) channel for conversations

We generally prefer GitHub Discussions for help requests as they are searchable and remain available to other members of the community.

## Announcements

The primary channel for release announcements is [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/discussions/categories/announcements).
We also post information about other important changes there.

Security vulnerabilities are tracked on GitHub and are published as [security advisories](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories?state=published).

In addition to the above, we also usually cross-post announcements to our [Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/dexidp) on CNCF Slack.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

If you've found a security vulnerability, please follow the disclosure process outlined [here](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/master/.github/SECURITY.md).

Alternatively, you can [open a draft security advisory](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/new) on GitHub.
This is where we keep track of vulnerabilities (and the work necessary to fix them) anyway,
so you can help us by filling out the necessary details in advance.

## Reporting bugs

Before reporting a bug or feature request, please:

- Check if it is still an issue in the [latest release](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/releases/latest)
- Check if it has already been reported in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues)

If it hasn't already been fixed or reported, create an issue in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues/new/choose).

## Requesting features and enhancements

If you are interested in contributing, feel free to reach out to the maintainers in one of the available communication channels.
They will help you get started. (A more detailed contribution guide is in the works)

Otherwise, open a feature request in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues/new/choose).

**Note:** If you are not sure if the nature of your requests fits into Dex or just want to discuss it first, we encourage you to reach out on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/discussions/new?category=ideas) first.
